## Cloud & Platform Engineer | Platform Architecture

I design and operate secure, large-scale cloud platforms across
AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for regulated enterprise environments.

My work spans platform architecture, networking, security, and
operational governance, with a focus on systems that are predictable
under load, resilient by design, and trusted during audits.

I have built and operated platforms across AI startups, top-tier
banking, airways, government, healthcare, and consulting, adapting
to both regulated and fast-moving environments.


## Areas of Platform Scope & Ownership

### Multi-Cloud & Platform Foundations
- Enterprise-scale platforms across AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure
- Standardised multi-cloud landing zones and organisational baselines
- Cloud-native, hybrid, and regulated deployment models

### Networking & Connectivity
- Secure network architectures (VPC/VNet design, segmentation, routing)
- Private connectivity, ingress/egress controls, and traffic isolation
- Network-level security controls and platform observability

### Compute & Orchestration
- Kubernetes platforms (EKS, GKE, AKS, Anthos) operating at scale
- Compute designs optimised for availability, resilience, and isolation
- Containerised and cloud-native compute patterns

### Data & Analytics Platforms
- Secure data platform integration across cloud-native and managed services
- Databricks lakehouse architectures for governed analytics and AI workloads
- Identity-aware data access, encryption, and platform-level controls
- Support for batch, streaming, and data-intensive workloads

### Security & Cyber Controls
- Identity-first security models (IAM, workload identity, RBAC)
- Policy enforcement, guardrails, and compliance-by-design
- Secure platform boundaries aligned to regulatory and cyber requirements

### Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD & Automation
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and modular platform blueprints
- Secure CI/CD architectures with controlled promotion models
- Policy checks, approval gates, and separation of duties in pipelines

### Observability, Reliability & FinOps
- Platform-level logging, metrics, and tracing for audit and incident readiness
- Reliability patterns for availability, recovery, and operational resilience
- Cost-aware platform design and FinOps-aligned controls
- Guardrails for sustainable cloud usage without limiting delivery velocity

### AI & ML Platform Enablement
- AI-ready cloud platforms across AWS, GCP, and Azure
- Secure data access patterns for model training and inference
- Isolation and governance for AI workloads in regulated environments
