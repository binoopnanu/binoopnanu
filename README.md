# Binoop Nanu

## Principal Cloud & Platform Engineer | Platform Architecture

I design and operate secure, large-scale cloud platforms across
AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for regulated enterprise environments.

My work spans platform architecture, security, and operational
governance, with a focus on systems that are predictable under load
and trusted during audits.
